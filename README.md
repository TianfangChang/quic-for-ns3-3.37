quic for ns3 3.37

The ns-3 code of quic in ns-3 App Store https://apps.nsnam.org/app/quic/ is adapted for ns-3 with waf compiler, end with ns-3 3.35.
To adapt ns-3 with CMake compiler, I edit some code and files.

- Adapt Makelist
- Remove unavailable code which may cause compiling error. 

I test the code in ns-3 3.37 version. Hope it can help you.
